Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Question 1:
The swing framework is a built-in Java class that supports different types of GUI components. The purpose of using swing frameworking with MVC is to use its ready-made components such as buttons, text fields, panels, etc.... This can be used in the "View" in the MVC pattern look better and can interact with the "Model" and "controller"(by listening to events such as when a button is clicked). Since Swing is completely based on JAVA, the components will appear the same, no matter the operating system used.
